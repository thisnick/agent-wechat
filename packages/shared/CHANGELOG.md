### Minor Changes

- [#187](https://github.com/thisnick/agent-wechat/pull/187) [`93cdb04`](https://github.com/thisnick/agent-wechat/commit/93cdb0482629b90f48ade6aa7dc111586f8117c8) Thanks [@thisnick](https://github.com/thisnick)! - Return the requested image quality without silently substituting a thumbnail. The CLI requests full resolution by default; use --thumbnail for the cached preview. HTTP clients that omit quality retain the legacy thumbnail-first behavior.

  Validate cached file attachments against their message's size and content hash before returning them, and reject titles containing filesystem paths.
