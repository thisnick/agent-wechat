# @agent-wechat/wechat

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#27](https://github.com/thisnick/agent-wechat/pull/27) [`8b07604`](https://github.com/thisnick/agent-wechat/commit/8b076041933b892d3361398646ddf1deb2268fc5) Thanks [@thisnick](https://github.com/thisnick)! - Proactive auth notifications: agent is notified immediately when WeChat auth is lost and can attempt re-login using cached credentials. Aligned all types with latest openclaw plugin SDK.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`0b45fba`](https://github.com/thisnick/agent-wechat/commit/0b45fba481778f5f7791b9787621270e1a9d1a23) Thanks [@thisnick](https://github.com/thisnick)! - Fix group message mention gating not working

  The monitor was not checking `msg.isMentioned` before dispatching group messages, so all group messages were processed regardless of `requireMention` config. Now:

  - Skips group messages that require mention but weren't mentioned
  - Sets `WasMentioned` in the inbound context for framework-level mention awareness

  - Detect WeChat process not running via `find_wechat_pid()` check before a11y observation
