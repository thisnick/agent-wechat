### Minor Changes

- [#279](https://github.com/thisnick/agent-wechat/pull/279) [`e31e6c4`](https://github.com/thisnick/agent-wechat/commit/e31e6c47a1c49bd1884403bc7acc1854c07bb43f) Thanks [@thisnick](https://github.com/thisnick)! - Add the AgentWechat desktop app for macOS, Windows and Ubuntu x64/ARM64, with a bundled local hub and CLI, system-keyring credentials, optional HTTPS network access and native file saving. Integrate signed Windows installers and notarized macOS packages into the prerelease release flow. Keep the standalone CLI independent, with protected credential files and a confirmed profile-removal command that retains local files.

  Add a browser chat client with account and group management, quoted replies, confirmed recalls, shared-link cards, searchable history, message previews and group avatars. Support photo/video viewing, zoom and swipe navigation, voice playback, original downloads, visible-avatar refresh, version-checked unread clearing and event-stream updates. Remember recent chats, drafts and verified media on the device without resending uncertain operations.

  Download received thumbnails and voice notes on the hub, and apply a per-account 50 MB default limit to automatic image, video, file and sticker downloads. Expose the policy through Settings, the API and CLI. Batch thread summaries from existing profile data without upstream requests or a separate stored preview model. Improve native profile initialization, group-operation locking and Windows credential/profile handling, with isolated simulator coverage for client workflows.
